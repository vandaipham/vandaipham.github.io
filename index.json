Many communication technologies have been developed in order to connect everything to each other and to the Internet. Besides, the long-range power-efficient wireless technologies have emerged such as LoRa (Long Range), which enables transmission over long distances with low energy consumption and can work within p2p, star or mesh topologies. In this paper, we analyze a model of a mesh topology for the LoRa network, which is attracting more interest in the applications of Smart City and Smart Agriculture. While the mesh topology is described by a graph, a method of route selection is considered based on the link quality related to Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) to find the optimal path from a source to a sink node. The network performance is evaluated by considering each node as a queueing system. As the analytic results, the routes are found from device nodes to the gateway, and the delivery latency is analyzed in the dependence on the load intensity and the number of relay nodes.","tags":["IoT","LoRa","mesh network"],"title":"Analytic Model of a Mesh Topology based on LoRa Technology","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581897600,"objectID":"cece5ed0f6a31ce4405d9ebac55b2482","permalink":"https://vandaipham.github.io/publication/icact2020p1/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icact2020p1/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently, unmanned aerial systems have emerged in different fields such as entertainment, military, Internet of Things, emergencies, etc. In these systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate with each other based on a flying network to provide services to customers such as live streaming, high-speed access point, etc. The mobility of UAVs can bring many advantages in emergency cases such as rescuing and searching victims in areas where the network infrastructure is not available. However, the crucial task needed to be done first is to locate the victims' coordinates. In this paper, we propose the positioning methods based on a flying network for emergencies by detecting the WiFi signals generated from victims' phones. A structure of UAV-swarms is considered to optimize the searching time. Considering proposed methods, the influence of the error of distance measurement and the number of received signals on the evaluation of the positioning process results is simulated.","tags":["Flying Network","UAVs","positioning"],"title":"Positioning Methods Based on Flying Network for Emergencies","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560816000,"objectID":"45fa022338880b9c96bc449b9afa5755","permalink":"https://vandaipham.github.io/publication/sensor2019/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sensor2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The success of the wilderness search and rescue missions is highly dependent on the time required to search for the lost person. The use of unmanned aerial systems may enhance search and rescue missions by supplying aerial support of the search process. There are unmanned aerial system–based solutions, which are capable of detecting the lost person using computer vision, infrared sensors, and detection of a mobile phone signal. The most pressing issue is reducing the cost of a search and rescue mission. Thus, to improve the efficiency of the resource utilization in wilderness search scenario, we consider the use of unmanned aerial system for both mobile phone detection and enabling Wi-Fi communication for the ground portion of the search and rescue team. Such an approach does not require specific additional tools (e.g. access point, specific user equipment) for communication, which reduces the cost and improves the scalability and coordination of the search and rescue mission. As a result, the article provides methods of searching the wilderness for a person using beacon signals from a mobile phone for two situations \":\" when the distance to the source of emergency signals is unknown and when the distance is known. In addition, the voice transmission delay and the number of unmanned aircrafts are found to guaranty the quality of a call.","tags":["Flying network","UAVs"],"title":"Unmanned aerial system–assisted wilderness search and rescue mission","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538697600,"objectID":"80843a82da9f5971028451a9cadc8cf5","permalink":"https://vandaipham.github.io/publication/icumt2018/","publishdate":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icumt2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most current trends in the development of telecommunications.

One of the key applications of this concept is the implementation of the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) and applications that will help to reduce the labor costs and costs of enterprises. Among such applications, undoubtedly, we can highlight Internet of things (IoT) and Augmented Reality (AR). The article discusses the interaction of applications of augmented reality with the Internet of things using the example of visualization of plant data collected by sensors and stored in a cloud service. A laboratory testbed is developed to measure the delay in the delivery of data from the cloud platform to the Augmented Reality application. The mechanism for uploading data to the local cloud is used to optimize the quality parameters. It helps to reduce the delay by introducing a new architecture for implementing IoT/AR applications.","tags":["IoT","AR"],"title":"Interaction of AR and IoT Applications on the Basis of Hierarchical Cloud Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535414400,"objectID":"6836db67af23f334b3645d52b2329309","permalink":"https://vandaipham.github.io/publication/new2an2018_2/","publishdate":"2018-09-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/new2an2018_2/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) applications have appeared on smart devices (smartphones, smart glasses, etc.) that have expanded the visual perception of users. With the appearance of new technologies, a huge number of new services are created and the quality of service provision for them also plays a really important role. Thus, the task of Quality of Experience (QoE) introduces interest to suppliers, service developers and users. This article discusses the issues of QoE in the implementation of AR services in big cities with a high density of users but not all users have the Internet access. To solve this problem, we propose to use Bluetooth 5.0 technology (BLE 5.0) to access the network. The interaction between the client and the server can be carried out by using D2D communication on BLE 5.0 through smartphones of other users, which are described by the queuing system model. The proposed model of providing augmented reality services was simulated. The simulation results show delays in the delivery of data, which depends on the number of BLE 5.0 nodes through which data is exchanged between the AR client and AR server, and also on the load factor.","tags":["IoT","AR"],"title":"Transmission of Augmented Reality Contents Based on BLE 5.0 Mesh Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503878400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503878400,"objectID":"f20d5a30f4c8d7062a094c1f8f7af231","permalink":"https://vandaipham.github.io/publication/new2an2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/new2an2017/","section":"publication","summary":"This article provides the results of the multimedia data transmission parameters research by LoRa using, in particular the results of images and voice transmission using the fragment of the model network in the Internet of Things Laboratory SPbSUT. During the series of experiments there was noticed the LoRa radio modules performance variation of different parameters (Bandwidth, Spreading Factor and Coding Rate), which have affected on the time and quality of image transmission. For image compression were used JPEG and JPEG 2000 methods, which have allowed to achieve an acceptable compression and image reconstruction while transmitting in the low-speed network. In the course of the experiment, the images were transferred from a camera mounted on a quadrocopter at distance of several kilometers. We considered such parameters as the time of data transfer, packet loss, estimation of the images quality obtained on the basis of subjective and objective methods. For voice compression, the A-law method was used, which allowed to compress the frame size by 4 times. Experiments of real-time speech transmission were conducted in different languages and evaluated by the experts. During the results analyzing there were defined the lower subjective score for Arabic, and the higher scores for English and Vietnamese. In conclusion, this article provides the results of the quantitative and qualitative dimensions evaluation and presents directions for the further research.","tags":["IoT","LoRa"],"title":"Transfer of multimedia data via LoRa","type":"publication"}]
